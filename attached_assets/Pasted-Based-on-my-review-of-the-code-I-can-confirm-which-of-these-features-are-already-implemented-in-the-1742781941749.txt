Based on my review of the code, I can confirm which of these features are already implemented in the current app:

Features Currently Available:
✓ Graph Data Format: The app uses a JSON format with separate nodes and edges arrays, which is appropriate for LLM consumption.

✓ Basic Search Connectivity: When a user selects a node and performs a web search, the search results are used to generate new nodes and edges connected to the original node.

✓ Visual Differentiation: Nodes and edges derived from web search are marked with "web search result" property and visually distinguished in the UI.

✓ Subgraph Tracking: The app assigns subgraph IDs to track which nodes and edges came from specific searches.

✓ Search Query Customization: Users can modify the suggested search query before sending it.

✓ Search Context: The system includes source node information and neighboring nodes in the search context.

✓ Confidence Scores: The implementation assigns different confidence scores to edges based on whether they connect to existing nodes.

✓ Citation Metadata: Search results include timestamp and query information in the metadata.

Features Partially Implemented:
⚠️ Graph Data Science for Relevance: There's a basic implementation using connection counts as a centrality measure through the findImportantNodes function, but it's not using advanced graph algorithms.

⚠️ Contextual Query Generation: The app generates suggested queries based on node type, but they could be more sophisticated.

Features Not Yet Implemented:
❌ Multi-hop Exploration: Currently only searches from a single node, not from paths or small subgraphs.

❌ Temporal Aspects: No special handling for temporal dimensions in the graph.

❌ Interactive Refinement: No way for users to approve/reject proposed nodes and connections.

❌ Entity Disambiguation: No advanced techniques for ensuring new nodes properly connect to existing nodes representing the same entity.

❌ Domain-specific Prioritization: No domain-aware relevance adjustment.

❌ Integration with Knowledge Graphs: No direct connection to structured knowledge graphs like Wikidata.

❌ Historical Search Context: No tracking of previous searches to avoid repetition.

Would you like me to focus on implementing any of these missing features? Or would you prefer to enhance one of the partially implemented features?
