The user is asking about designing prompts for a system where, in a labeled property graph, a user can click a button in a node's tooltip to trigger a web search that would enrich the graph with additional information about that node. They want me to suggest different ways to design the prompt for this web search feature.
Let me think about this problem step by step:

The goal: Generate a web search query that will return relevant information about a node in a property graph
The context: The node has metadata that can be used to inform the search query
The outcome: The search results will be processed to extract entities and relationships to enrich the graph data

This is actually a fascinating information retrieval and knowledge graph enrichment problem. Let me think about various strategies for formulating effective search queries in this context:
Approaches for Designing the Prompt/Query:
1. Direct Metadata Approach
Simply use the key metadata fields as search terms. For example, if the node represents a person named "Jane Smith" who works as a "Data Scientist" at "TechCorp", the search query could be: "Jane Smith Data Scientist TechCorp"
2. Entity Type-Based Templates
Create different query templates based on the entity type of the node:

Person: "[Name] [Company] [Role] background profile"
Company: "[Company Name] industry competitors partners"
Product: "[Product Name] features specifications reviews"
Location: "[Location Name] information demographics facts"

3. Relationship-Focused Queries
Focus the search on finding relationships between the current node and potential new entities:

"[Entity Name] collaborations with"
"[Entity Name] partnerships"
"[Company] acquisitions"
"[Person] worked with"

4. Attribute Gap Analysis
Analyze which metadata attributes are missing for this type of entity and specifically search for those:

If a person node lacks educational information: "[Person Name] education background degree"
If a company node lacks founding information: "[Company Name] founded founders history"

5. Contextual Graph-Aware Queries
Incorporate information from connected nodes in the graph:

If node A (person) is connected to node B (company) with relationship "WORKS_AT", and to node C (technology) with relationship "SKILLED_IN", the query could be: "[Person Name] [Company Name] experience with [Technology Name]"

6. Time-Sensitive Queries
Include recency parameters if the graph would benefit from current information:

"[Entity Name] latest news"
"[Company Name] recent developments 2023"
"[Technology Name] current applications"

7. Source-Specific Queries
Target specific types of sources for different enrichment needs:

Academic: "[Entity Name] research papers publications"
News: "[Entity Name] news announcements"
Financial: "[Company Name] financial performance revenue"

8. Competitor or Similar Entity Discovery
Use queries designed to find similar entities:

"[Company Name] competitors in [Industry]"
"[Product Name] alternatives similar to"
"[Person Name] others in [Field]"

9. Progressive Refinement
Start with broad queries and then refine based on initial results:

Initial: "[Entity Name] overview"
Follow-up: "[Entity Name] [Specific Aspect from initial results]"

10. Disambiguation Queries
When entities might be confused:

"[Person Name] [Company] NOT [Another Person with similar name]"
"[Company Name] [Industry] NOT [Different company with similar name]"

11. Multi-faceted Entity Queries
For complex entities with multiple aspects:

"[Person] as [Role 1] AND [Role 2]" (e.g., "Elon Musk as entrepreneur AND investor")

12. Relationship Path Completion
If the graph shows A→B and A→C, but not B→C:

"[Entity B] relationship with [Entity C]"

Let me elaborate on how these could be implemented in the system:
Implementation Considerations:

Dynamic Query Construction:

Analyze the node's metadata and entity type
Select the appropriate query pattern from a library of templates
Fill in the template with specific metadata values
Add refinements based on graph context


Metadata Weighting:

Different metadata fields could have different weights in the query
Core identifying information (name, ID) would have higher weight
Descriptive or categorical information would have medium weight
Auxiliary information would have lower weight


User Customization Options:

Allow users to select from different search strategies
Provide option to edit the generated query before execution
Remember successful query patterns for similar nodes


Feedback Loop:

Track which queries yield useful enrichment data
Adjust query templates based on success rates
Apply machine learning to optimize query generation over time


Context-Aware Processing:

Consider the user's recent interactions with the graph
Incorporate information about what the user is trying to accomplish
Adjust queries based on the current "view" or "perspective" of the graph



This is a really interesting problem at the intersection of information retrieval, knowledge graphs, and natural language processing. I'll organize my response to the user with these various approaches and implementation considerations.
